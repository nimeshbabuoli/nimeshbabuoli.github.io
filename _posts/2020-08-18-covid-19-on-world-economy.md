<p style='text-align: justify;'>Due to the ongoing lockdown or some form of restrictions in the movement of people and doing businesses, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted a dire situation in the World Economy in which growth is projected to contract by 4.9 % in 2020. According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Trade contraction was close to 3 % (year over year) in the first quarter and is projected to drop by around 18.5% (year over year) in the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to the pandemic and partly due to other factors like US-China Trade War. 

Developing and emerging countries face a greater challenge relatively for they do not have the health-care systems and fiscal resources on par with that of the developed world. Under-developed countries will face challenges even worse than all of them.
