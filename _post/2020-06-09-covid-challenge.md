title: "RECON COVID-19 challenge"
subtitle: Bringing the R community together against COVID-19
---

We are proud to announce that the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/)
has awarded RECON a grant for $23,300 to develop the *RECON COVID-19
challenge*, a project aiming to centralise, organise and manage needs for
analytics resources in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to support the response
to COVID-19 worldwide.

These resources will permit to expand our initial preliminary collection of
[github issues](https://github.com/reconhub/covid19hub) to create a
user-friendly web platform gathering R tasks reflecting needs from different
projects and groups, and facilitate contributions from the wider R programming
community.

We are looking for **two consultants** (see '*We need you!*' section below),
including:

* a **project manager** to drive the project forward
* a **web developer** to create the website


### The RECON COVID-19 challenge in a nutshell

The RECON COVID-19 challenge aims to bring together the infectious disease
modelling, epidemiology and R communities to improve analytics resources for the
COVID-19 response via a website which will provide a platform to centralise,
curate and update R development tasks relevant to the COVID-19 response. Similar
to the Open Street Map Tasking Manager ([tasks.hotosm.org](tasks.hotosm.org)),
this platform will allow potential contributors to quickly identify outstanding
tasks submitted by groups involved in the response to COVID-19 and ensure that
developments follow the highest scientific and technical standards.

While this project is aimed at leveraging R tools for helping to respond to
COVID-19, we expect that it will lead to long-lasting developments of
partnerships between the R and epidemiological communities, and that the
resources developed will become key assets for supporting outbreak responses
well beyond this pandemic.

proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/106T_Bbp3XyWMVrfix2qcslwg9cJoJ90m/view?usp=sharing).
