I"m!<p style="text-align: justify;">Donald Trump was ascended to the throne on a promise of “America’s First” which contradicted the US’s position on a number of foreign policy issues. His way of framing US foreign policy almost totally in business terms neglecting the history, strategy and diplomacy had favored him by the American Public during the Presidential elections. Despite the rhetoric in his campaign, most of his foreign policy decisions were more or less conventional and it was clearly evident that his decisions were made by the foreign policy elites. Trump’s idiosyncratic way of taking foreign policy decisions for domestic consumption to boost his popularity and keeping the long-standing policy and national interests at odds was not something to cherish about. In spite of all these, Trump was more successful than he appears to be vis-à-vis foreign policy.

<h4>Saudi Arabia</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to its strategic importance, US relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have been a kind of mixed bag, some hot patches followed by some cold ones. These behaviors could be noticed with the previous administration's relations with the kingdom but Mr. Trump once came to power it shifted from being cautious with each other to be brothers in arms. Mr. Trump who has displayed public affection towards authoritarian and dynasty rule loved the House of Sauds so much so he publicly admired the regime even though it was facing worldwide backlash for the alleged murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In addition to turning blind eye to the atrocities committed by the kingdom in the region, multiple reports have also surfaced which alleges Mr. Jared Kushner, personally handpicked by Mr. Trump with a task to solve the crisis in the Middle East, being directly influenced by his decision-making regarding the region by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad Bin Salman (MBS). 

Very few analysts had anticipated Trump as a president would make the Saudi Kingdom his first official trip abroad contrasting his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. His message was clear that the middle east certainly matters and it matters a lot. Trump’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.france24.com/en/20170520-trump-saudi-arabia-sign-110-billion-arms-deal-counter-iran">110bn arms deal</a> with the Kingdom will have long-term ramifications on the peace and stability of the Middle East given the kingdom's hostility with Shia Neighbor Iran and the never-ending war in Yemen.

<h4>Qatar</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the 15 days of the Riyadh summit held in May 2017, Qatar faced a diplomatic crisis when UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia cut their diplomatic relations with its tiny neighbor. Trump's unequivocal support for the blockading nations at the very beginning being ignorant about the fact that the US has its <a target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/05/middleeast/qatar-us-largest-base-in-mideast/index.html">Middle East’s largest military base</a> located in Qatar. His ignorance of the fact that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23007401">Doha hosts the Taliban</a> in their country to have peace talks for solving the conflict in Afghanistan where a couple of thousands of US troops are stationed. Contrary to Trump’s rhetoric, the US State Department urged for dialogue in resolving the Qatar diplomatic crisis.

But, at the end of the Trump presidency, the dispute between Qatar and blockading nations of Saudi- Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Bahrain seems to have been resolved as the Emir of Qatar traveled to the historic city Al-Ula of Saudi-Arabia on 5th of January, 2021 for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit.

<h4>JCPOA and Iran</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A hard-fought deal, the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), One of Obama’s signature foreign policy successes was scrapped by the Trump Administration which severely questioned the trustworthiness of US leadership in the international arena. Moving away from this agreement gave Iran an excuse to produce enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear bomb. Hardliners are on the rise in Iran as Moderate President Hassan Rouhani is facing backlash within the country for trusting the United States. Recently, the United States was diplomatically isolated when the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dw.com/en/un-security-council-rejects-iran-arms-embargo-extension/a-54576786">UN Security Council voted against continuing the arms embargo to Iran</a> when the US was supported only by the tiny Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic. Even the traditional allies including the ones it has a special relationship did not side with Uncle Sam.

<h4>Qasem Soleimani incident</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trump's hawkish approach to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/middleeast/qassem-soleimani-iraq-iran-attack.html">assassinate the head of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major General, Qasem Soleimani</a> , nearly led to a military confrontation with Iran. Such a risky move could have resulted in the disruption of peace and stability in the Middle East, risking Global Oil supply and shrinking the world economy. This also ignited fears within Iranians and bolstered the legitimacy and support for the theocratic regime in Tehran. Certainly, the killing was in US interest because Soleimani had American personnel’s blood in his hand. But, taking such bold steps requires a clear strategy and assessment of possible repercussions that had not happened.

<h4>Yemen Crisis</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Trump administration has turned a blind eye to the atrocities committed by the Saudis and Emiratis in impoverished Yemen by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/03/yemen-airstrikes-saudi-arabia-mbs-us">supplying destructive weapons, providing intelligence</a>, refueling fighter jets in the air just to protect the economic interests and jobs at home. He even vetoed the resolution passed by both the house and senate that could have ended the military assistance to the Saudis for their role in Yemen. He has given <a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/saudi-arabia-trump-statement-business-reaction-186fc27d-658d-4076-8e4b-bc5935a5fac7.html">Saudi Arabia a free pass in the middle east</a> even when the crown prince faced backlash for the alleged murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The US administration’s policy of turning a blind eye to the human rights atrocities committed by its allies in the Middle East is simply appalling which not only undermines the American values but also shows the hypocritical nature of the US foreign policy. Giving the Saudis a free pass for the murder of US-based journalist, Jamal Khashoggi and naming Egypt’s dictator Abdel Fatah Al-Sisi as his favorite dictator doesn’t go in line with core American values.

<h4>Libyan Crisis</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After toppling Colonel Gaddafi in Libya, the United States has not taken a responsible role in the Libyan Conflict. The Trump administration was no exception. Officially, the United States <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/whos-who-libyas-war">recognizes the Internationally recognized government led by  Fayez al-Sarraj</a> who is backed by Turkey but <a target="_blank" href="https://ly.usembassy.gov/u-s-delegation-meets-with-general-khalifa-haftar/">remains in contact with warlord Khalifa Haftar</a> as well. Trump Administration’s disinterestedness to find a meaningful solution in Libya and acting as a Neutral party has not aided in solving the Libyan Conflict. This was one of many instances in which the administration has failed to showcase the US leadership to mitigate the crisis.
</p>

<h4>Turkey Relations</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turkey and the US were already having a rocky relationship strained by regional policy differences and mutual distrust even before Trump became commander in chief. There were signs of a thawing of the relationship which was complicated by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/us-sanctions-turkey-over-russian-s400.html">Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 missile defense</a> from Russia. The release of Pastor Brunson from Turkish Jail and abandoning the Kurds in northern Syria by the US helped in thawing the relationship but has been very low.
