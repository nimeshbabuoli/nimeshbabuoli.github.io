I"≤<p style="text-align: justify;">Donald Trump was ascended to the throne on a promise of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs First‚Äù which contradicted the US‚Äôs position on a number of foreign policy issues. His way of framing US foreign policy almost totally in business terms neglecting the history, strategy and diplomacy had favored him by the American Public during the Presidential elections. Despite the rhetoric in his campaign, most of his foreign policy decisions were more or less conventional and it was clearly evident that his decisions were made by the foreign policy elites. Trump‚Äôs idiosyncratic way of taking foreign policy decisions for domestic consumption to boost his popularity and keeping the long-standing policy and national interests at odds was not something to cherish about. In spite of all these, Trump was more successful than he appears to be vis-√†-vis foreign policy.

<h4>Saudi Arabia</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to its strategic importance, US relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have been a kind of mixed bag, some hot patches followed by some cold ones. These behaviors could be noticed with the previous administration's relations with the kingdom but Mr. Trump once came to power it shifted from being cautious with each other to be brothers in arms. Mr. Trump who has displayed public affection towards authoritarian and dynasty rule loved the House of Sauds so much so he publicly admired the regime even though it was facing worldwide backlash for the alleged murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In addition to turning blind eye to the atrocities committed by the kingdom in the region, multiple reports have also surfaced which alleges Mr. Jared Kushner, personally handpicked by Mr. Trump with a task to solve the crisis in the Middle East, being directly influenced by his decision-making regarding the region by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad Bin Salman (MBS). 

Very few analysts had anticipated Trump as a president would make the Saudi Kingdom his first official trip abroad contrasting his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. His message was clear that the middle east certainly matters and it matters a lot. Trump‚Äôs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.france24.com/en/20170520-trump-saudi-arabia-sign-110-billion-arms-deal-counter-iran">110bn arms deal</a> with the Kingdom will have long-term ramifications on the peace and stability of the Middle East given the kingdom's hostility with Shia Neighbor Iran and the never-ending war in Yemen.

<h4>Qatar</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the 15 days of the Riyadh summit held in May 2017, Qatar faced a diplomatic crisis when UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia cut their diplomatic relations with its tiny neighbor. Trump's unequivocal support for the blockading nations at the very beginning being ignorant about the fact that the US has its <a target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/05/middleeast/qatar-us-largest-base-in-mideast/index.html">Middle East‚Äôs largest military base</a> located in Qatar. His ignorance of the fact that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23007401">Doha hosts the Taliban</a> in their country to have peace talks for solving the conflict in Afghanistan where a couple of thousands of US troops are stationed. Contrary to Trump‚Äôs rhetoric, the US State Department urged for dialogue in resolving the Qatar diplomatic crisis.

But, at the end of the Trump presidency, the dispute between Qatar and blockading nations of Saudi- Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Bahrain seems to have been resolved as the Emir of Qatar traveled to the historic city Al-Ula of Saudi-Arabia on 5th of January, 2021 for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit.
