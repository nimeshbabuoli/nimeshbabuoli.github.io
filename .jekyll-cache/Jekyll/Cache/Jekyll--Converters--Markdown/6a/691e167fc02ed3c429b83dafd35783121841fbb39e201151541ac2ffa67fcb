I" <p style="text-align: justify;">Diplomacy is simply the art, science, or management of the relationship between countries (eg. Russia, India, Nepal), international organizations (eg. World Bank, UN, IMF, EU) in a skillful way by the professionals called Diplomats. Diplomacy has always been a non-violent approach in maintaining relationships among nations and organizations through dialogue, negotiations, mediation, and reconciliation. International alliances, agreements, treaties, and other foreign policy actions are negotiated, dealt, agreed, or signed through diplomats who represent their respective homeland and organization. Diplomacy by a state dates back to the period of Renaissance where diplomatic missions of different Italian states were established at each otherâ€™s territory. The modern form of diplomacy started on the rise from the 16th century and evolved into the complex form that we have nowadays.</p>
