I"M<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the ongoing lockdown or some form of restrictions in the movement of people and doing businesses, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted a dire situation in the World Economy in which growth is projected to contract by 4.9 % in 2020. According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Trade contraction was close to 3 % (year over year) in the first quarter and is projected to drop by around 18.5% (year over year) in the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to the pandemic and partly due to other factors like US-China Trade War.
