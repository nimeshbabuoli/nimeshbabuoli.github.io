I"{<p style="text-align: justify;">Donald Trump was ascended to the throne on a promise of “America’s First” which contradicted the US’s position on a number of foreign policy issues. His way of framing US foreign policy almost totally in business terms neglecting the history, strategy and diplomacy had favored him by the American Public during the Presidential elections. Despite the rhetoric in his campaign, most of his foreign policy decisions were more or less conventional and it was clearly evident that his decisions were made by the foreign policy elites. Trump’s idiosyncratic way of taking foreign policy decisions for domestic consumption to boost his popularity and keeping the long-standing policy and national interests at odds was not something to cherish about. In spite of all these, Trump was more successful than he appears to be vis-à-vis foreign policy.
